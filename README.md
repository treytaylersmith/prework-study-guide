# <Prework-Study-Guide>

## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

- What was your motivation?
- Why did you build this project? (Note: the answer is not "Because it was a homework assignment.")
- What problem does it solve?
- What did you learn?

Created a small study guide for bootcamp students, giving them (and myself) a place to look back to and update as the need arises to study or freshen up on foundational development facts.
